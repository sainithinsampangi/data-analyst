# 💳 Power BI Project: Credit Card Fraud Risk Analysis | End-to-End Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard created by me to analyze credit card transactions and fraud patterns.
The dashboard provides a clear, interactive visual representation of fraudulent vs non-fraudulent transactions and helps identify trends, risk factors, and behavioral patterns.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🧹 **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Prepare transactional data for fraud risk analysis.
- 🔎 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detect fraud trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- 📊 **Build Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize fraud metrics with slicers, filters, and drill-downs.
- 📈 **Risk Assessment Metrics**: Identify high-risk transactions and analyze fraud probability.
- 🤖 **Predictive Insights**: Explore how banks can leverage BI and analytics for fraud prevention.
- 🌍 **Real-World Applications**: Understand how financial institutions detect and combat fraud daily.
